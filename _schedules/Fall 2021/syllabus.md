# Data Pipelines

University of Amsterdam / Programming Lab / 5082DAPI6Y

## Syllabus<br><small>Fall 2020</small>

This course is the continuation of Python for Data Processing. A data pipeline
is a sequence of steps that transforms raw data into something more useable.
The course will taught in slightly modified form this semester, and we'll focus
on two aspects in particular. For the first half we'll learn about classes and
using them to represent data in your program. The second half of the course
will be about other types of represenations of data and the transformations you
can apply to them.

<br />

There are two types of werkcollege in this course. The *[Q&A]* sessions are
intended for asking question and additional explanations about topics already
covered in the reading or video material. The *[Optional]* session will be
a technical lecture going beyond what is covered in the material. The
material covered there will not be part of the exam material and attendance
will not be recorded.

* **[Q&A] Classes & Object Oriented Programming** on *Tuesday November 3rd at 11:00*: <https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/89113452090>

* **[Q&A] Logistic Regression** on *Wednesday November 4th at 11:00*: <https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/83486211050>

* **[Example] Classes & Object Oriented Programming** on *Thursday November 5th at 11:00*: <https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/84271541766>

* **[Optional] Cost function & Maximum Likelihood Estimation** on *Friday November 6th at 11:00*: <https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/86416860823>

## Asking questions

If you have any question about the material, there are several ways to get
assistance.

### Ed Q&A Forum

The first place you should try and ask your question is on the Ed
[Ed forum](https://us.edstem.org/courses/2334/). Details on using *Ed* can be
found in the Welcome post there.

### Videocall on Discord

If you have a very specific question, something that would require sharing
a large portion of your solution, or you are unsure how exactly to phrase your
question for Ed, you can request a videocall with the staff. You can do so on
Discord, using the *QuestionQueue* bot.

The question queue will be open **every weekday from 9:30 to 13:30**. If you
send the *QuestionQueue* bot a direction message starting with `!ask` and then
followed by your question, you will be added to the queue. The staff will take
videocalls from the queue in the order they are asked, and you will be notified
by the *QuestionQueue* bot when it is your turn.

### Email the staff

If you have personal matters to discuss or other questions that do not fit any
of the formats above, you can email the course staff at <minorai@mprog.nl> 

## Passing the course

Your grade for this course will consist of the grades for each of the modules in
this course. Each of the modules will each be graded on a 1 to 10 scale. Your
grade will mainly depend on the style and design of your code.

Design

: This is about adding effective abstractions to your code. Simple examples
might be to use a loop instead of copy-pasting code, or writing a function for
code you want to reuse several times.

Style

: This is about how readable your code is for other people. For example, using
clear variable names, adding comments and adding whitespace to separate blocks
of code, all can help with the readability.

If you've completed the entire module and your code produces the correct
output, your grade starts at 6. The remainder of your grade is then
determined as follows:

* 0 - Style and design of the code are of insufficient quality. Code does produce correct output and open questions have been answered.

* 1 - Style and design have had some attention, but there are still clear improvements to be made. Answers to any open questions are mostly correct.

* 2 - Style and design are of sufficient quality, answers to open questions are correct.

* 3 - Style and design are very good, answers are correct and show understanding.

* 4 - Exceptional style and design, answers are beyond expectations.

### Exam

Once you've completed all modules there will be an oral exam. This exam will
be scheduled individually with the course staff and will also be *pass/fail*.

Once you've passed the exam, your final grade will be computed as the average
of all your grades for the modules.


## Academic honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on the course's test and quiz is not permitted at all.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).

- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.

- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.

- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.

- Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.

- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Turning to the course's heads for help or receiving help from the course's heads during the quiz or test.

- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.

- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.

- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

- Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.

- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.

- Decompiling, de-obfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problem sets.

- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.

- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.

- Looking at another individual's work during the test or quiz.

- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.

- Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.

- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.

- Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.

- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.

- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.

- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's heads.

- Turning to humans (besides the course's heads) for help or receiving help from humans (besides the course's heads) during the quiz or test.

- Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.
