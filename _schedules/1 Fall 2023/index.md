# Data Processing and Representations

University of Amsterdam / Programming Lab / 5082DAPI6Y

## Syllabus<br><small>Fall 2023</small>

This course is the continuation of Python for Data Processing. In data
processing we take raw data, apply transformations to make this data more
usable for some task, and combine this in a representation that is easier to
program with. For the first half we'll learn about classes and using them to
represent data in your program. The second half of the course will be about
other types of representations of data and the transformations you can apply to
them.

## Staff

Tim Doolan (coordinator)

Wouter Vrielink (teacher)

You can reach us at <minorai@mprog.nl> for any practical matters or other
questions.

## Schedule

The core schedule for this course, combined with Introduction to Machine Learning 2, is
built around working with the material each weekday from 9 to 5.  For this we
have one room on the Science Park campus permanently reserved for minor AI
students, namely **L0.11**, which provides enough space for all of you to work
on campus full-time.

Most on-campus activities, including practical assistance, will generally be
held in this room. There are some exceptions with activities that do not fit
in the room, like the group seminars and the exam. The schedule for these
group seminars can be found on Datanose [here](https://datanose.nl/#course[113607])

The schedule for the practical assistance hours and quiz/lectures that will be held
in L0.11 can be found in the "Asking Questions" section below.

### Deadlines and daily schedules

The deadlines for each module can be found on the module schedule pages
(the first item in the sidebar for each module).

We've found that it can be difficult for students to plan when to work on what
part of the material, especially with two completely new courses, that together
require a full-time time investment. Being unfamiliar with a subject makes it a
lot harder to estimate how long something might take, and structuring your work
can be more difficult. To help with all of this, we've made a day-to-day schedule
for each module, which indicates what elements should be completed each day.

If you're finding it hard to keep on track with the daily schedule, you can
contact the staff at <minorai@mprog.nl>. We can discuss possible approaches or
even offer extra help or resources, if needed. In general, it is a good idea to
already contact us if are more than 1 day behind on the schedule, so we can
look at possible solutions early.

#### Part-time students

If you are a part-time student, you can just follow the part of the daily
schedule intended for your half of the program. You should still attend the
group seminars with the other students, but can otherwise choose which days
you are present and which days of practical assistance combine best
with your own schedule.

## Asking questions

If you have any questions about the material, there are several ways to ask them 
and get assistance. 

### Practical assistance

There are 3 hours scheduled every day where you can ask practical
questions to the TA's of the minor. During these hours you can use the
"Request assistance" feature on the *Introduction to Machine Learning 2* [website](https://ml2.proglab.nl/), 
using the question mark symbol at the top of the sidebar. Please use this feature instead of raising your hand
in class, as it ensures that all questions get handled in the order that they 
are asked. Questions can of be about either the DPR or ML2 courses, just make 
sure to mention what assignment you're working on. For your location, please 
list the  table you are working at, so the TA handling your question knows 
where to find you when it is your turn.

The hours are scheduled as follows:

* In general, assistance hours are from 10 to 13
* On Monday there are group seminars in the morning, so the assistance hours are from 13 to 16

### Quiz/lectures

Each quiz/lecture will start with of a number of basic questions on the theory
of that module. These questions will not be graded, but serve only to check
your own understanding of the theory. After the quiz there will be a lecture,
where certain topics might be elaborated on further, depending the answers in
the quiz. At the end there will also be room to ask any other questions on the
theory you might have.

The schedule for these quiz/lectures can be found as part of the daily schedule
for the module, or in Datanose. The quiz/lectures will always be in the main
room L0.11 at 14:00 on the scheduled day.

### Email the staff

If you have personal matters to discuss or other questions that do not fit any
of the formats above, you can email the course staff at <minorai@mprog.nl>

## Exceptions

Below you can kind the policies for the different kinds of possible exceptions
and circumstances.

### Absences and calling in sick

If you are sick or are otherwise unable to come to campus, you should inform
your group TA you will be absent by sending them a message on Slack. When you
are feeling better, inform your TA again, so your period of absence can be
registered.

Depending on how long you were sick, and if you are behind with the module, you
can then also contact the course staff to discuss an alternate planning for the
module. Note that this option requires you to have also already messaged your
TA at the start of your absense. Any exceptions or extensions required for this
will need to be discussed with course staff (so not your TA). See the extension
policy below for more details.

### Extension policy and late days

There are two types of extension; staff extensions and late days.

Staff extensions usually require meeting with staff and will generally also
include making an alternative planning for the module. If any circumstances
arise that would make it hard for you to make the deadline, send us an
email at <minorai@mprog.nl> so we can discuss your situation. Please do this as
soon as the problem arises, rather than on the day of deadline, so we can
schedule a meeting and still have room in the module for an alternative planning.
Note that a meeting does not always guarantee an extension, as this might still
depend on the details of your circumstances.

In addition, for this course and Introduction to Machine Learning 2, you have a
combined total of 2 late days, each of which you can use to get a single 24
hour extension for the module deadline. You can request a late day using the
submit forms linked in the topbar of the *Introduction to Machine Learning 2*
[website](https://ml2.proglab.nl). You must always submit your
request *before* the deadline expires. Any submissions received after the
deadline without a requested late day will not be graded, meaning your grade
will default to a 1.

You can use only 1 late day per module to get a 24 hour extension on the deadline.
This extension is for the whole module, so applies to both courses. If the deadline
is on a Friday, using  a single late day will instead grant a 48 hour extension
over the weekend, meaning your deadline will move to Sunday. If you have used both
late days, or require more than 24 hours of extension, you may still try and
request a staff extension.

Any staff extension request needs to be agreed upon before the deadline expires,
which means your request must be sent at least 2 hours before the actual deadline.
If you do not receive a reply in time, you should *always* still submit your
current version of the assignment before the deadline, so this part can still be
graded. Staff extension requests should be emailed to <minorai@mprog.nl>

## Passing the course

This course consists of 3 larger assignments, that have been divided into 2
modules each. For the first module of an assignment, you'll only receive
feedback on your code, which you can use the to improve your work. Then, for
the second module, you'll hand in the full assignment, which will be graded on
a 1 to 10 scale. Your grade will mainly depend on the style and design of your
code.

Design

: This is about adding effective abstractions to your code. Simple examples
might be to use a loop instead of copy-pasting code, or writing a function for
code you want to reuse several times.

Style

: This is about how readable your code is for other people. For example, using
clear variable names, adding comments and adding whitespace to separate blocks
of code can all help to make your code more readable.

If you've completed the entire assignment and your code produces the correct
output, your grade starts at 6. The remainder of your grade is then
determined as follows:

* 0 - Style and design of the code are of insufficient quality. Code does produce correct output and open questions have been answered.

* 1 - Style and design have had some attention, but there are still clear improvements to be made. Answers to most open questions are correct.

* 2 - Style and design are of sufficient quality, answers to open questions are correct.

* 3 - Style and design are very good, answers are correct and show understanding.

* 4 - Exceptional style and design, answers are beyond expectations.

### Attendance

We expect you to be present and working on campus every weekday from 9 to 5.
The material of these course covers a lot of practical skills, which cannot
just be learned from reading a book or watching a video. This means we expect
you'll need to ask plenty questions while working on assignments, as you try and
master these different skills. This is why we offer a lot practical assistance,
so there is a chance for you to ask the questions you have about the
scheduled material *every day*.

In spite of this, we maintain a soft attendance requirement. This means that
there is no hard rule stating that if you miss a certain percentage of days,
you will fail the course, i.e. attendance does not directly affect your final
grade.

However, indirectly attendance definitely will affect your grade. The material
requires you to work regularly on the assignments and ask questions along the
way so you don't get stuck. This means if you are not on campus, you are much
more likely to get stuck longer and thus end up with too little time before the
deadline.

In addition, we will still take attendence samples regularly in the room. This
does not affect whether you pass or fail the course, but is used as metric to
give us an indication of the effort you are putting into following the courses
as intended. If you request an extension or exception, or ask for extra
help or resources for the material, we'll always take your attendance into
account when considering your request. Requests from students who miss attendance
are generally much less likely to be granted.

If you are done with all the material for the module before the day of the deadline,
you should show your assignments to a TA by asking a question *during practical assistance*. The TA
will check if they agree every element has been properly completed, and if so
 you'll be granted exemption from the attendance checks for the rest of the module.

### Exam

The exam will be another *pass/fail* exam. More details on the exam will follow
later.

Once you've passed the exam, your final grade will be computed as the weighted
average of the 3 graded assignments in the course. The 2 larger assignments will
both have twice as much weight as the smaller assignment.

## Academic honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable".
The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can
facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line
between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This
policy characterizes both sides of that line.

### Collaboration

The essence of all work that you submit in this course must be your own.
This means that for collaboration with other students you can discuss
the material and consider possible approaches together, but you should then
always still each write your own code. So, conferring together using language
and whiteboards is permitted and even encouraged, but sharing lines of code is
not.

Note that looking at another students screen or solution file at this stage
will usually result in that option becoming *the* solution to the problem, and
so instead of learning and considering all the possibilities, you just end up
trying to recreate the solution you already saw. As there usually quite a few
different ways to solve programming problems, this can even end up with code
that is similar enough in structure that it is caught by our automated
plagiarism detector.

### Helping other students

Once you've completed a part of an assignment, viewing another student's solution
is fine and can even be very helpful. At this point you can help other students
to find bugs in their code, or even do a code review together when you're both
done. Helping other students to find bugs in their code is something that is
also definitely encouraged, but this should always be limited to suggestions on
what to try next, not fixing the code for them. If you are trying to suggest a
fix, but cannot do so without sharing your own code (which is common enough
when you are still learning!), then you should refer the problem to a TA or
teacher instead.

The general principle here is that you can look at another's code to help fix a
bug, but they cannot look at your code for ideas on how to solve it. Note that
sharing a solution with someone who has not yet completed that part of the
assignment is considered plagiarism just as much as handing in another students
solution. Doing this deprives the other student from learning what they need
to learn in that assignment, which will only make it more difficult for them to
solve subsequent assignments on their own.

### Using online tools

Searching for solutions to (parts of) the assignments online is obviously not
permitted. This explicitly also includes asking ChatGPT or other large language
models to write the code for you, which is consider plagiarism just as much as
copying a solution written by another human.

What is permitted though, is searching for explanations on how to use certain
functions or perform specific operations in Python. So, searching for *"how do
I add an element to a list in Python"* would be perfectly fine, while searching
for *"how do I print a Mario pyramid in Python"* would not. If your search
leads to a Stack Overflow page or similar resource, which gives an example of
how to perform an operation, you should always cite the source as a comment
in your own code. This citation comment should contain the original link and
clearly indicate which parts you did not write yourself, but came from the
online example.

As a student it can sometimes be hard to estimate what is and isn't ok to
search for online, which is logical while you are still learning. We strongly
recommend that you err on the side of caution with this, and ask staff
permission beforehand for a specific search when in doubt. As this is an
introductory course, you should actually be able to find all the relevant
Python instructions on the pages of this course without needing to search
online at all.

### Rules and guidelines

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the
course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some
act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in
writing from the course's staff. Acts considered not reasonable by the course
are handled harshly.

In all cases we follow the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the
University of Amsterdam and of the Kunstmatige Intelligentie BSc programme.

#### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about assignments in English, Dutch, or some other spoken language.

- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.

- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.

- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.

- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to assignment problems.

- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.

- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

#### Not Reasonable

- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to assignments online or elsewhere.

- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.

- Asking ChatGPT or other large language models to write the code for (part of) an assignment for you.

- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.

- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to part of an assignment when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.

- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.

- Providing or making available solutions to assignments to individuals who might take this course in the future.

- Splitting an assignment's workload with another individual and combining your work.

- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual.
