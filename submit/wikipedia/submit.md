# Submit

Here you can submit your solutions to the problems in your module. Take note:

- Ensure that all programs have the right name. For example, when submitting `prime.py`, a files named `prime (1).py` or `primetest2.py` will not be accepted!

- You may submit and re-submit without limit up until the deadline. However, each time you submit, you need to submit all problems at once.

- In case of problems submitting, ask your teacher or send an e-mail to <minorai@mprog.nl>.

**There will be no grade for this module, but you will get feedback on your code. This feedback can then be used to improve your code for the next module. You will resubmit all these files.**
