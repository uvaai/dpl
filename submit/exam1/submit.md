# Submit exam

Here you can submit your solutions to the exam. Take note:

- Define any functions and/or classes you write at the top of the file, and add the provided tests at the bottom of the file in order of the exercises.
- Make sure the provided tests are *all* printed (or shown) when running your program. Separate the prints for each exercise with an extra print like `print("\n=== Exercise 1 ===")`, so it is clear which output belongs to which exercise.
- Not all exercises need to be perfect to pass the exam. If you do not know how to proceed, describe what you want your code to do.
- Double-check that your programs are correct by checking the example output.
- You may submit and re-submit without limit up until the deadline.
- **Before you leave the exam room, check with us that your submission was correctly submitted!**
