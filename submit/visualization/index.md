# Submit Visualization

Here you can submit your solutions to the problems in your module. Take note:

- You must submit a Jupyter Notebook file that contains your code and visualization (you do not have to submit the Bokeh tutorial notebooks).

- Your notebook should work with the original data set (do not change the name or contents of `gapminder.csv`).

- Your notebook should clearly state and answer your research questions.

- You may submit and re-submit without limit up until the deadline.

- In case of problems submitting, ask your teacher or send an e-mail to <scientific@mprog.nl>.
