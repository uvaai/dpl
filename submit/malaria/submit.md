# Submit

Here you can submit your solutions to the problems in your module. Take note:

- Ensure that all programs have the right name. For example, when submitting `prime.py`, a files named `prime (1).py` or `primetest2.py` will not be accepted!

- You may submit and re-submit without limit up until the deadline. However, each time you submit, you need to submit all problems at once.

- In case of problems submitting, ask your teacher or send an e-mail to <ai@proglab.nl>.

**Note:** Your files can not exceed 5mb in total size (all added together). If your `malaria_exploration.ipynb` notebook is too large, `display()` less images in your notebooks, and double-check your number of prints.

**This module will be graded. Use feedback from the previous module to improve your code.**
