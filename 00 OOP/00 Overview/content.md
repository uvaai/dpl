# Object Oriented Programming

In this module, you'll implement several exercises with use of a programming paradigm called Object Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a method of structuring your code by bundling properties and behaviours into individual objects. It enables you to quickly write effective and abstract code that is easy to use, without having to remember every single detail of how it was implemented.

We will start this module off by watching a video on OOP:

If you are still unsure if you understand everything, [this is a very nice read-up for OOP](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/). It discusses everything from the video above, and even some concepts that you will need in the final exercise.

## Familiarisation

Before we get ourselves into implementing more complicated OOP principles, let's first familiarise ourselves with the simpler ones!

1. If you haven't yet, create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/join). For now, you'll only need it to access the Game of Cards exercises.
2. Practice with [Queue](https://lab.cs50.io/minprog/programmeren-2/2019/problems/queue/lab)
3. Practice with [Game of Cards](https://lab.cs50.io/minprog/programmeren-2/2019/problems/cards/lab)
4. Watch [this video on IDs](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Naming-objects/418249/459118-4.html)

## Hangman

Now that you are more familiar with

1. Download the [dictionary](https://dpl20.mprog.nl/course/00 OOP/dictionary.zip)
2. Implement [Hangman](/oop/hangman)
3. Implement [Evil Hangman](/oop/evil-hangman)
