# Crawling

## Web crawling & HTML scraping

This exercise, we will practice scraping from multiple websites using web-crawling. You will learn how you can acquire data from multiple pages by following links. Youâ€™ll be scraping data from IMDB, the Internet Movie DataBase!

For this exercise, we have provided you with some code that makes HTML backups of a few selected webpages. You will write code that scrapes IMDB's top 250 movies index page and the individual movie pages yourself.

Download [here](imdb-crawler.py). You should submit your version of this script along with the output CSV file (`top250movies.csv`).

The goal of this exercise is to create a CSV file containing the following data for each movie in the top 250:

* Title of movie
* Runtime
* Genre (separated by semicolons if multiple)
* Director(s) (separated by semicolons if multiple)
* Writer(s) (separated by semicolons if multiple)
* Actors (only the first three actors listed, separated by semicolons)
* Ratings
* Number of Ratings

Make sure that your python script produces results that do not need additional cleanup. For example, the entry "Writer" should only contain "Stephen King; Frank Darabont", not "Stephen King (short story "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"); Frank Darabont (screenplay)".

Your output should look like [`sample_HTML.csv`](sample_HTML.csv).

### Hints

* Have a look at the `find()` function in the documentation of BeautifulSoup4 and look for  the CSS selectors, they will make this exercise much easier!
* The script will likely be slow, but that is no problem.

## Alternative exercise

You are allowed to create a script from scratch that crawls a different datasource, but it should be of similar complexity to this exercise. This means that it should have at least 5 attributes per entry and at least 200 entries. Also, to collect all information, you should at least follow links to other webpages (do not just scrape a single webpage). If you are unsure whether your data source is complex enough, please ask in class.
