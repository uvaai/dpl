JavaScript is another programming language which works quite different from what you're used to with Python. The JavaScript programming language is used specifically for webpages. \n",

    "This *bokeh* library, and most other visualization tools that are similar to *bokeh*, are based on JavaScript and therefore sometimes use the logic from JavaScript (but of course, Python syntax). If you know JavaScript, it is probably a bit easier to understand what every element does. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important JavaScript principle that is used here is a callback. A callback is when you give a function definition with some arguments in your code, which you expect to be called later on again. In this example, the callback function is `update_color` and the moment when this function is called is *when the widget changes*, which happens when the user selects another color. This function is then called with what `attr`ibute changes (in this case always `\"value\"`), the previous value `old` from before the change, and the new value `new`. This callback is added to the widget with the function `on_change`, which in turn calls the function every time something changes in the widget, with exactly those three arguments. Below this example, you can find a simpler callback example."
