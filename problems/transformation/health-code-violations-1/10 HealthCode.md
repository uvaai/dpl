# Health code inspections

For this assignment we'll be working with restaurant health code inspection
data from the city of Seattle. It lists which restaurants were inspected when,
and how severe any health code violations were. This might range from simple
things like not having thermometers installed in the fridge and or a lack of
labeling on food containers, to more serious concerns like not separating raw
and cooked foods, or not keeping the establishment clear of rodents and
insects.

Download the data files for this assignment [here](Seattle_Health_Code.zip).
Note this file is quite large, so downloading it might take a while. Then, create a Python Notebook named `transformation_YELP.ipynb`.

Get started by loading the data in `Health_Code_Violations_Seattle.csv` and
take a first look at the type of data it contains. If you want to print the
data frame, make sure to only print the [head](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html)
as the file is reasonably large. For this whole assignment, you should take
some care with what parts of the data you try to print and inspect, as is it
can take quite a while to print all of it.

We'll combine this data with restaurant reviews from *Yelp* to see if we can
find any indicators that a restaurant has serious health code violations. The
research question we'll try and answer with this combined data is:

* Are there any words whose presence in a *Yelp* review might indicate that
there is a serious health code violation present at a restaurant?

Given such a list of words, we could then automatically select certain
restaurants for inspection, which could help the *Washington State Department
of Health* reduce the number of serious health code violations.

## Yelp Data

The health code inspections for Seattle you've just loaded from the CSV will be
one part of the data. The other part will be the Yelp reviews for restaurants
from the same area. To answer our research question, we're going to try and
match these 2 different data sources, so find reviews and inspection results
that are about the *same* restaurant.

The reviews we will be using are a part of the [Yelp open dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset),
which is a subset of *Yelp* data that is made publicly available. All this Yelp
data is in *JSON* format, which you might not be familiar with yet. JSON is a
very common format on the web and is probably the second most common format you
will encounter for data, after *CSV*. Read a short introduction on JSON
[here](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) if you've never worked
with the format before.

Take a look at the [documentation](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main)
for the dataset to get an idea of the types of data it contains exactly. The
goal we have here, based on our research question, is to match health code
inspections with reviews. However, `review.json` only contains `business_id`'s
for each review, which we cannot directly link to the inspections. The
`business_id`'s can be found in another file though, `business.json`, that also
contains the more descriptive name and address information for the business.
Linking each review to their respective business will therefore be a good first
step.


### Reading the data

Python has a built-in module for processing JSON files, unsurprisingly called
`json`. You can load JSON objects from a string format using [loads()](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/json.html#json.loads).
The result will be some combination of dictionaries and lists, both familiar
Python datastructures, which take the place of *objects* and *arrays* in JSON
respectively.

Open the `business.json` file with a text editor and inspect what the structure
is exactly. Write some code to read this file and process the JSON objects
using `loads()` from the `json` module. If you need a refresher how to read
files in Python, take a look [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files).

As we've discussed earlier, we'll need to match these businesses to reviews,
which means searching for each business by `business_id`. Given this dataset is
really quite large, programming this search efficiently will be crucial, so
we'll use a dictionary to speed up the search. As we'll be searching for the
`business_id`'s, we'll be using those as the dictionary **keys**. The
**values** should be the JSON objects containing all the other information
about the business.

Thinking ahead, we'll want to combine all the reviews for a business in one
place, so add one more attribute to the JSON object of each business, called
`'reviews'`, which should be an empty list (we'll fill it later). The final
structure should look something like:

    {'nxeMvqQDJ5ocA4toqRE3CQ': {'business_id': 'nxeMvqQDJ5ocA4toqRE3CQ',
                                'name': 'Ximaica',
                                ...,
                                'categories': ['Restaurants'],
                                'reviews': []},
     'oyxW3ZP60Z9b7F3LciaCjQ': {'business_id': 'oyxW3ZP60Z9b7F3LciaCjQ',
                                'name': 'XO Bistro',
                                ...,
                                'categories': ['French', 'Restaurants'],
                                'reviews': []},
     '0iyzWPc4C58sAJUAAE-BIg': {'business_id': '0iyzWPc4C58sAJUAAE-BIg',
                                'name': 'Xplosive Mobile Food Truck',
                                ...,
                                'categories': ['Food', 'Vietnamese', 'Food Trucks', 'Filipino', 'Restaurants'],
                                'reviews': []},
     ...}

Remember, *don't print the whole data frame!*

> #### Sidenote: Considerations for structuring data
>
> Before filling this dictionary with reviews, we'll take a brief
> aside to discuss different ways to represent this (or any other) data, and why
> you might choose one method over the other. The main consideration here is
> between representing your data in a flat table-like structure, like a pandas
> *DataFrame*, or a hierarchical structure consisting of dictionaries and lists,
> like the *JSON* structure. Knowing both methods will be useful when choosing
> the structures for you own data processing projects.
> <br/><br/>
> The `business.json` data seems like it is actually very close to data you might
> represent in a *DataFrame*. In fact, if the `'categories'` attribute wasn't a
> part of the data, it would be natural to interpret every attribute as a
> column name and every new line as a new row in the DataFrame. Pandas even comes
> with a built-in function to convert json data to a DataFrame: [read_json](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_json.html).
> <br/><br/>
> One of the problems here is that we can't easily convert the part of the data
> which is hierarchical, e.g. objects or lists contained in other objects (like
> `'categories'`), as there is no clear conversion to a flat table format. However,
> we could just choose to drop the `'categories'` part of the data, as it isn't
> directly relevant to our research question, and then we could use some of the
> nice pandas features to process the data. Specifically, merging data from
> different sources can easily be done in pandas: [merge DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging)
> <br/><br/>
> Merging allows you to combine DataFrames based on values in a specific column,
> making news rows consisting of each of the matched pairs, which would instantly
> solve the problem of matching the `business_id`'s of the reviews and of the
> business descriptions together. Having a hierarchical representation has its advantages
> too though, as all relevant data can be stored together; the reviews can just
> be put in a list contained *within* each business object (the empty `reviews` list you
> just added), whereas in a DataFrame we'd have to perform computationally
> expensive `groupby()` operations every time we'd want to do something with
> all the reviews for a business.
> <br/><br/>
> There are trade-offs to both structures and a valid argument could be made for
> using either structure here. However, after this merge, we'll want to also merge in the
> inspection results, which would become a very complex DataFrame with *a lot* of
> duplicate information. So in our case, here we will already make the choice to utilize a
> dictionary representation, based on the other transformations we will need
> to do with the data later on.

### Merging the JSON reviews

Now, lets actually merge the reviews into the business dictionary. Read the
`review.json` file into your program, reusing some of the code from loading
`business.json`. When you've loaded a review object, search for the
corresponding business in your business dictionary and add the review to the
list of reviews there. The merged results should end up looking something like:

    {'nxeMvqQDJ5ocA4toqRE3CQ': {'business_id': 'nxeMvqQDJ5ocA4toqRE3CQ',
                                'name': 'Ximaica',
                                ...,
                                'categories': ['Restaurants'],
                                'reviews': [{'review_id': 'XmAqfWFa_GyBj5nmU_ETXA',
                                             'business_id': 'nxeMvqQDJ5ocA4toqRE3CQ',
                                             ...,
                                             'stars': 3.0,

                                             'business_id': 'nxeMvqQDJ5ocA4toqRE3CQ',

                                             'business_id': 'nxeMvqQDJ5ocA4toqRE3CQ',
                                             'stars': 5.0,

                                            ...]},
    ...}


## Matching the inspections with reviews

Next we'll get started with the harder part of combining this data: merging the
inspection results into this same structure. Take a quick look at the file
containing all the inspections, which you have already loaded at the start of this
assignment. The most logical way to match these inspection results to the
reviews is through using the name of the business, but since these names are
written by different inspectors and reviewers, it might be hard to match them
*exactly*. We could also include information like address to try and get a more
accurate match, but the address information in the inspection file seem to be
missing often, so that probably won't improve results.

The business names in the inspection results look like they are formatted a
little differently too, so we'll need to do some conversions to ensure they
match the names used in the business descriptions. The names appear to be in
uppercase, so that'll definitely be something to fix. Also, it is probably a
good idea to remove any nonalphabetic characters, as those are very likely to
be used inconsistently in different data sources. Write a function called
`clean_name()`, which takes a restaurant name, converts it to all lowercase and
removes any nonalphabetic characters.

When merging in the inspection results with the review data, we'll be
repeatedly be searching for a restaurant with a specific name, and not its
`business_id`. So while doing these conversions, it would also be a good idea
to restructure the dictionary containing the data so we can easily search based
on the name of the restaurant. The *values* of this new dictionary should be the
same as in the old dictionary, but the *keys* should the cleaned restaurant
names, instead of the id's. Also, to clean up the data a little more, remove
all restaurants that don't have any reviews, as they won't help answer our
research question. Finally, add a new attribute `'inspections'`, containing an
empty list, in each object, just like you did for the reviews, where all the
inspection results can be merged into.

> #### Sidenote: Efficiency of transformations

> Making a whole new dictionary with different keys might seem inefficient and

> (converting the restaurant names to the cleaned format), with the sole aim of
> reducing the complexity of the next transformation.

The restructured dictionary should end up looking something like:

    {'youngs restaurant': {'business_id': 'IbRT1K1TQ7mFXjlIZ9onUw',
                           'name': "Young's Restaurant",
                           ...,
                           'categories':  ['American (Traditional)', 'Chinese', 'Restaurants'],
                           'reviews':     [{'review_id': 'K90lbzJj_HUVxqkhp87bIA',
                                            'business_id': 'IbRT1K1TQ7mFXjlIZ9onUw',
                                            ...,
                                            'stars': 5.0,
                                            'text': "One of my favorite breakfast/brunch ..."},
                                           {'review_id': 'qTcdlvOHiI84_5e6mfe2QQ',
                                            'business_id': 'IbRT1K1TQ7mFXjlIZ9onUw',
                                            ...,
                                            'stars': 3.0,
                                            'text': "Honestly I wanted to try this place ..."},
                                           ...],
                           'inspections': []},
     'yu shan':           {'business_id': '0rqp9CbHsZZEw1UOUHInWg',
                           'name': 'Yu Shan',
                           ...,
                           'categories':  ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'],
                           'reviews':     [{'review_id': 'KOwWTvfTcl7jCbu8xoWxmw',
                                            'business_id': '0rqp9CbHsZZEw1UOUHInWg',
                                            ...,
                                            'stars': 5.0,
                                            'text': "This five star is for in house only ..."},
                                           {'review_id': '1cQGC96CIWC3HhULg_F6Dw',
                                            'business_id': '0rqp9CbHsZZEw1UOUHInWg',
                                            ...,
                                            'stars': 1.0,
                                            'text': "I ordered this food for delivery ..."},
                                           ...],
                           'inspections': []},
     ...}


### Merging in the inspections

Now apply the same `clean_name()` function to every name in the inspections
DataFrame. Use [map()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.map.html)
to apply the function to entire `'Name'` column at once and store the result in
that same column. Using the same `clean_name()` function to clean up both sources
of data should ensure consistent results for this transformation, so names that
started out the same should still match after these transformations are applied.

Loop over the inspections DataFrame using [iterrows()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iterrows.html)
and search for the (cleaned) name in your restaurant dictionary. Add the
inspection to the list of inspections for that restaurant. Transform the row
*Series* to a dictionary using [to_dict()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.to_dict.html),
to make the data consistent in type.

The final result of combining all these data files in single structure should
look something like:

    {'youngs restaurant': {'business_id': 'IbRT1K1TQ7mFXjlIZ9onUw',
                           'name': "Young's Restaurant",
                           ...,
                           'categories':  ['American (Traditional)', 'Chinese', 'Restaurants'],
                           'reviews':     [{'review_id': 'K90lbzJj_HUVxqkhp87bIA',
                                            'business_id': 'IbRT1K1TQ7mFXjlIZ9onUw',
                                            ...,
                                            'stars': 5.0,

                                           {'review_id': 'qTcdlvOHiI84_5e6mfe2QQ',
                                            'business_id': 'IbRT1K1TQ7mFXjlIZ9onUw',
                                            ...,
                                            'stars': 3.0,
                                            'text': "Honestly I wanted to try this place ..."},
