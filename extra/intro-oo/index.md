# Populations

You have been using many objects in earlier assignments. Every string, number, set, dictionary, list, etc. is an object. But you haven't learned yet what an object really is.

In this module you will learn a very powerful programming paradigm: object oriented programming.

Most modern programming languages provide some form object oriented programming. The main principles are similar in most programming languages, but the details might differ a lot.

In the coming two modules you'll learn about classes in Python, after which you will apply this knowledge to build an multi-agent system in which you simulate the interaction between foxes and rabbits. In this module you will implement phases 1-5 which are about creating the agents and having them move around.

Next module, you will implement phases 6-8 and experiment with the simulation. In phase 6 you'll implement the fox's specific behavior (hunger) and interaction between species you'll implement in phases 7 and 8. 

**There will be no grade for this module, but you will get feedback on `phase_5.py`. This feedback can then be used to improve your code for the next module, in which you will continue with your simulation.**
