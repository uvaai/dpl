# Populations

In many of the previous assignments you have unknowingly been working with objects. Every string, number, set, dictionary, list, etc. is an object, but we haven't delved into what exactly an "object" is in the context of programming. In this module, we will explore the powerful programming paradigm known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Most modern programming languages support some form of Object-Oriented Programming, and while the core principles are similar across these languages, the implementation details can vary significantly.

Over the next two modules, we will focus on object-oriented programming in Python by building a multi-agent system in which you simulate the interaction between foxes and rabbits. n this module, we'll cover phases 1 to 5, which involve creating agents and simulating their movement. In the following module, we'll progress to phases 6 to 9, where we'll implement specific behaviors for the foxes (like hunger) and interactions between different species. We'll also conduct experiments with the simulation, gather data on its dynamics under various input parameters, and, finally, formulate and answer our research questions based on the model we've created.

**There will be no grade for this module, but you will get feedback on `phase_5.py`. This feedback can then be used to improve your code for the next module, in which you will continue with your simulation.**
