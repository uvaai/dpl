# Scraping and Crawling

In this module we will continue with the data we have scraped from IMDB in the previous module. After transforming and visualizing the data we will focus on web crawling. Web crawling is a technique where a program visits multiple webpages and scrapes each page for information. An example of where this technique is used, is by search engines to update their web content. In our case, we will use it to scrape information from different pages.

**This module will be graded.**
