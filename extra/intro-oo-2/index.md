# Populations and SQL

In this module you will finish implementing phases 6-8 and experiment with the simulation from the previous module. In phase 6 you will implement the fox's specific behavior (hunger) and interaction between species will be implemented in phases 7 and 8. In phase 9 you will do some preparations that enable us to run many experiments using a range of input parameters. You will then proceed with gathering data on the dynamics of our model with different input parameters. Finally, you will propose and answer your own research question on the created model.

**This module will be graded.**
