# Visualization

Communicating your scientific results in an effective way is an important step in research. Often, when exploring a dataset or when you're evaluating some statistical analysis, creating insightful visualizations of the data is an essential part of the process. Data visualizations can take the form of, for example, charts, graphs or tables.

Interactive data visualization allows a user to interact with the data in question. In some cases, this might lead to a greater understanding of the data compared to static visualizations. Users can perform actions like for example selecting data, highlighting data or filtering data.

In this module you'll create your first interactive visualization in Python. We will make use of one of the available libraries for interactive visualizations in Python: Bokeh. The tools we provide in this module can be helpful in the final part of this course, your own data visualization project.
