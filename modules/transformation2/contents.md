# Data Transformation (cont.)

Generally speaking, there are 2 types of data transformations:

1. **Filter, merge or restructure data.** These operations do not alter the content
of the data, but modify the general structure in some way. The simplest example
would be selecting specific rows from a data frame, but you might do something
more complex like combining data from several sources.

2. **Compute or extract new features:** For example, rescaling a column in a data
frame to change the temperature units from *Fahrenheit* to *Celsius*. This
changes the values inside the data frame cells, so it *does* modify the data
content. Another common transformation would be to compute an average or
maximum of a feature, extracting new content from the data.

For this module you'll complete the data transformation assignment from the
previous module.
